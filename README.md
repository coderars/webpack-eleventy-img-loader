# webpack-eleventy-img-loader

Requires Node 12+

Webpack 5 image loader built around [@11ty/eleventy-img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@11ty/eleventy-img) (uses [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)) to convert and optimize images.

The purpose of this loader is to reduce dependencies for your [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) based projects. It'll use your existing 11ty packages, so there's no need for another image processor to handle images running through Webpack. Fewer dependencies mean faster builds.

## Installation
```
npm install webpack-eleventy-img-loader
```
